# Brief #
As the document states, we're not looking for an implementation in any particular language or framework, so please use what you're most comfortable with. The goal is for you to demonstrate your technical ability and problem solving skills. There are no fixed requirements for the code, instead I'm more interested in your decision making and attention to detail.

These are some considerations, all of which we are not expecting to see at once:
- Data persistence
- Unique statistics
- Feature and/or Unit Tests
- User interface to inspect data (graphical or otherwise)
Feel free to email your code, including a README, or if you are using a private GitHub repo grant me collaborator access with me, if you'd prefer: nadinengland
